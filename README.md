I'm currently working on other Attack on Titan NPCs.  


## Description
This is a tool to create simple events in Stardew Valley.  

This is not a foolproof event maker!  
Just a helpful tool for building event structure and basic actions.  

Event information: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data.
